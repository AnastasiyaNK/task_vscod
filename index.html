        <title>Hello, world! 🌍 I’ve decided to become a frontend developer.</title>
        <p>Why? Because I love watching everything break after missing just one tiny symbol. 😅</p>
         <p>In six months, I won’t just be coding — I’ll be summoning bug-fixing mode 🧙‍♂️. My life will turn into an endless loop: coding → debugging → Googling → crying → coding again.</p>
          <p>But no worries! Soon, I’ll be building such awesome projects that even Stack Overflow will ask me for help. 🔥</p>
                   <p>P.S. If you see me in six months, don’t be surprised by my red eyes — it’s just those late-night Webpack bundles. 😎</p>
